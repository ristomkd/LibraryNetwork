📖 Project Overview

This project is a multi-library management system built with ASP.NET Core MVC and ASP.NET Core Identity.

The system allows multiple libraries to operate independently within the same application. Each library is managed by its own administrator (librarian), while members can browse books and manage their own loans.

The application enforces strict server-side role-based authorization and library-based data filtering to ensure data isolation between libraries.
